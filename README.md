# Obstacle-Detector
This project builds an autonomous car that moves forward and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. When an obstacle is detected within 5 cm, it stops, turns left, and continues moving. An RGB LED provides feedback, flashing red for distant obstacles and solid green when clear. Arduino controls the system.
